# Java-practice
I always see myself as a developer and an active learner. I seek challenges in everyday life. 
Now I am embarking on a new journey. 
I created this repo for 3 reasons:
  1. Keep records while learning a new but most popular language -- JAVA. 
  2. Write some git code everyday,to keep my git skills in fresh.
  3. Provide a place for everyone to communicate and solve interesting problems.
